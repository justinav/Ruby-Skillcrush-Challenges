#Ruby SkillCrush Blueprint
These are projects for SkillCrush's [Ruby Blueprint](http://skillcrush.com/blueprint/ruby-rails-developer/)

So far we have covered Ruby basics like:
- Hashes
- Methods: Each Method, Inspect Method, Initialize Method
- Attribute Accessors
- Loops
- Refactoring
- Case Statements
- If/Else Statements

Soon we will be working on web apps and using Sinatra and Ruby On Rails!
